# Streamlit Setup

Documentation [https://docs.streamlit.io/](https://docs.streamlit.io/)


To set up your Python environment and test your installation, execute the following terminal commands:

```bash
pip install streamlit
streamlit hello
```

Working with Streamlit is simple. First you sprinkle a few Streamlit commands into a normal Python script, then you run it with streamlit run:

```bash
streamlit run your_script.py [-- script args]
```
